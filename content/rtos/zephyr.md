The Zephyrâ„¢ Project is a scalable, real-time operating system (RTOS) supporting multiple hardware architectures, optimized for resource constrained devices, and built with security in mind. This Linux Foundation hosted project embraces open source development values and governance on its mission to unite leaders from across the industry to produce a best-in-breed solution.

### Features
- Security. The Zephyr Project was developed with security in mind.The project employs an in-depth security development life cycle through all stages of development including: security validation, fuzz and penetration testing, frequent code reviews, static code analysis, threat modeling and reviews to prevent back doors in the code.
- Connectivity. The Zephyr Project provides connectivity protocols optimized for low powered, small memory footprint devices. The project will support Bluetooth, Bluetooth LE, WiFi, 802.15.4 as well as other standards like 6Lowpan, CoAP, IPv4, IPv6, and NFC.
- Modular. The Zephyr project provides developers with feature-rich software optimized for memory constrained devices. The Zephyr kernel and associated software modules can run on systems as small as 8kB of memory all the way up to 512 kB. It is designed to allow complete freedom to use the RTOS as-is or to tailor a solution by enabling or disabling almost every feature via kconfig to define the best configuration for your device.
