TI-RTOS Kernel (formerly known as SYS/BIOS

<!--more-->

### Features
- TI-RTOS Kernel and its associated IPC and XDCtools components provide a rich set of C-callable, deterministic kernel services that enable developers to create sophisticated applications without compromising real-time deadlines.
- The TI-RTOS Kernel provides multithreading, scheduling and synchronization services, complemented by three different memory managers. Logging, tracing, and general system services (e.g. abort, exit) are provided by the XDCtools run-time component. The Inter-Processor Communication (IPC) component provides transparent message passing and other IPC mechanisms.
- Objects from all three components are configured, built, and traced using a common tool infrastructure, providing a seamless user experience.
